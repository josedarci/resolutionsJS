          <p>
            Benjamin recently bought a digital clock at a magic trick shop. The
            seller never told Ben what was so special about it, but mentioned
            that one day Benjamin would be faced with a surprise.
          </p>
          <p>
            Indeed, the clock did surprise Benjamin: without warning, at
            someTime the clock suddenly started going in the opposite direction!
            Unfortunately, Benjamin has an important meeting very soon, and
            knows that at leavingTime he should leave the house so as to not be
            late. Ben spent all his money on the clock, so has to figure out
            what time his clock will show when it's time to leave.
          </p>
          <p>
            Given the someTime at which the clock started to go backwards, find
            out what time will be shown on the curious clock at leavingTime.
          </p>
          <p>
            For your convenience, here is the list of months lengths (from
            January to December, respectively):
          </p>
          <p>
            • Months lengths: 31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31.
          </p>
          <p>Please note that in leap years February has 29 days.</p>
          <p>Example:</p>
          <p>
            For someTime = "2016-08-26 22:40" and leavingTime = "2016-08-29
            10:00", the output should be solution(someTime, leavingTime) =
            "2016-08-24 11:20".
          </p>
          <p>
            There are 2 days, 11 hours and 20 minutes till the meeting. Thus,
            the clock will show 2016-08-24 11:20 at the leavingTime.

        const endTime = new Date(leavingTime);
    
        // Calcula a diferença em milissegundos entre os dois horários.
        const timeDiff = endTime - startTime;

        const finalTime = new Date(startTime.getTime() - timeDiff);
    
        // Formata o horário final como "AAAA-MM-DD HH:MM" e retorna.
        const formattedTime = finalTime.toISOString().slice(0, 16).replace("T", " ");
        return formattedTime;
    }
    
    // Testa a função com o exemplo fornecido.
    const someTime = "2016-08-26 22:40";
    const leavingTime = "2016-08-29 10:00";
    console.log(solution(someTime, leavingTime)); // Deve imprimir "2016-08-24 11:20"
